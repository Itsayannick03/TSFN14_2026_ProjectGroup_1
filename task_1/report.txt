Scalability Issues:
- Risk of race condtiotions
	Scince booking is handled concurently Doubble booking issues may occour if two persons try to book at the same time.
- our system deoends on an email service and our database
- Resorce usage
	Since we only have one entry point resource usage will most likley increase.


Fault tollerance:
- Single point of failure
	If backend crashes, everything goes down same with
- No recovery
	When the server goes down it will not automatically restart
- Otherwise we have relativly good error messaging. The site wont go down in case of errors
